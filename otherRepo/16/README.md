# Project 16: Enhancing the image analysis community in Galaxy

## Abstract

Although Galaxy has a strong presence in fields like genomics and proteomics, it has yet to fully establish itself in the imaging community. Presently, efforts to integrate tools and create workflows for image analysis in Galaxy are scattered across research fields and locations. To address this issue, this project aims to foster collaboration among members interested in using Galaxy to improve the reproducibility, shareability, and reusability of scientific analysis, regardless of their scientific or technical background.

This project aims to leverage the resources and expertise of Euro-BioImaging -the European research infrastructure that provides open access to imaging technologies, training, and data services-, and Simula Research Laboratory -a Norwegian non-profit research organization- to create a community that develops FAIR computational workflows for image analysis.

## More information

The long-term goal is to create a solid community that thrives to create reproducible and FAIR image analysis workflows. The short-term one is to coordinate the efforts leveraging an event in which the stakeholders are often present. The plan is delineated in the goals mentioned above:

 * Gather all the existing resources for image analysis in Galaxy (tools in the Galaxy ToolShed, training materials, and workflows in the WorkflowHub).
 * Create a list of tools widely used in the image analysis field that are not yet integrated into Galaxy.
 * Annotate the existing image analysis tools that are lacking annotations with EDAM-Bioimaging.
 * Create a community of practice page in the Galaxy Community Hub.

We are aiming at having the project leads working on it but with close collaboration with the abovementioned communities present at the event (Galaxy, EDAM-Bioimaging).

We welcome different levels of expertise: from Galaxy tool developers to image analysis enthusiasts.
