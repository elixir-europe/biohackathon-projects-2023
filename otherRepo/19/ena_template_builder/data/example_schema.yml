    description: |
      A Study is a container for a sequencing investigation that may comprise 
      multiple experiments. The Study has an overall goal, but is otherwise
      minimally defined in the SRA. A Study is composed of a descriptor, zero or 
      more experiments, and zero or more analyses. The submitter may decorate the 
      Study with web links and properties.
