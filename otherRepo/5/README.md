# Project 5: BioHackrXiv and publications

## Abstract

During the Biohackathon we want to work on metadata for publications in the context of BioHackrXiv.org - the markdown based pre-publishing biohackathon platform for project reporting that is used by a handful of biohackathons every year, including the Elixir and Japanese biohackathons. This has resulted in over 40 publications, so far, with 200+ authors. The number of submissions is increasing every year.

In previous years we worked on improved support for publications, including an improved preview/PDF generation experience and CiTO support. Also we mapped out future work for BioHackrXiv in this unpublished [doc](https://github.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/blob/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2022/paper.md) where we want to improve metadata handling and the publishing system itself. These are obvious topics to work on during the Elixir biohackathon 2023.

A full list of supported hackathons can be found [here](http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/) and a list of publications [here](https://biohackrxiv.org/discover).

## More information

Long term project has been going for years. For plan see abstract above. We would like to be with 2 active team members (Pjotr & Arun) on-site to be able to write code. We will have at least one remote participant (Gianluca) and other experts that are likely in other biohackathon groups (Egon, Tazro, Toshiaki).

## Lead(s)

Pjotr Prins, Tazro Ohta, Arun Isaac
