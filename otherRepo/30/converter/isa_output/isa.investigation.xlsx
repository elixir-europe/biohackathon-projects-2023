Investigation Title	Single-Cell Transcriptomics Sheds Light on the Identity and Metabolism of Developing Arabidopsis Leaf Cells											
Investigation Description	Being the main photosynthetic instrument of vascular plants, leaves are crucial and complex plant organs. To establish the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of these different leaf tissues, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of individual cells isolated from young leaves of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in two different environmental conditions. The detection of ~19,000 different transcripts in over 1,800 high-quality leaf cells revealed 14 cell populations composing the young, differentiating leaf.

Study Protocol Description	Protoplasting protocol was adapted from (Ryu et al., 2019). Briefly, the third leaf of 40 plants per sample was harvested, chopped and incubated in 2 ml enzyme solution (0.4 M mannitol, 10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MES, 20 mM KCl, 2% (wt/vol) cellulase and 0.5% (wt/vol) macero enzyme) constantly shaking for 30 min at room temperature. After a 7-min centrifugation at 100 g, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml washing solution (0.4 M mannitol, 10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MES and 20 mM KCl). Resuspended cells were filtered through a 50-μm cell strainer, which was washed with 0.5 ml of washing solution. Cells were sorted on the Melody FACS, where gates to sort out debris of dead cells were pre-defined via a test sample that was DAPI-stained (viable cell ratio 31%, prior to sorting). Subsequently, 100,000 cells per sample were sorted in less than 10 minutes.	Arabidopsis Col-0 was grown under a long-day regime (16h-light and 8h-dark, intensity 110–120 μmol m−2s−1) at 21 °C on the WIWAM platform (http://www.wiwam.be). Five seedlings were grown per pot in order to obtain 40 seedlings per sample. The seeds were sown in 85±1 g of Saniflor compost (Van Isreal N.V., Geraardsbergen, Belgium) with an average absolute water content of 70%. Plants were watered daily until 8 days after stratification (DAS) with a well‐watered regime of soil relative water content (RWC) 69% (2.2 gwater/gsoil). At 9 DAS, half of the pots (randomized) were not watered until harvest (14 DAS) while the other half kept the well-watered regime.	Single-cell suspensions were loaded on a GemCode Chromium Instrument (10X Genomics) to generate single-cell gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead and Library Kit, version 3 (10X Genomics, Cat. 1000075) and the Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (10x Genomics, Cat. 120262) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, reverse-transcription was performed in a 96-deep-well reaction module at 53°C for 45 min, 85°C for 5 min and ending at 4°C. Next, GEMs were broken and cDNA was cleaned up with DynaBeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. 37002D) and SPRIselect Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter, No. B23318). Full-length, barcoded cDNA was amplified at 98°C for 3 min, 12 cycles at 98°C for 15 s, 67°C for 20 s and 72°C for 1 min, 1 cycle at 72°C for 1 min and ending at 4°C. 	Illumina-ready sequencing libraries were prepared after clean-up with the SPRIselect Reagent Kit and enzymatic fragmentation via end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, post-ligation SPRIselect clean-up and sample index PCR using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library Kit (10X Genomics, Cat 1000078). The cDNA content of pre-fragmentation and post-sample index PCR samples was analyzed using the 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent). 	Sequencing libraries were loaded on an Illumina NovaSeq flow cell performed at the VIB Nucleomics Core (VIB, Leuven, Belgium) with sequencing settings according to the recommendations of 10x Genomics for 3’ gene expression. The read lengths were the 10X recommendations for v3 chemistry: I1 = 8; R1 = 28; R2 = 91	Normalization, detection of high variable genes, scaling, clustering and dimensionality reduction were performed using Seurat (top 30 principal components). The absence of a strong doublet-effect on the clustering was verified. After validating the biological meaning of the clusters (i.e. marker genes expression did not indicate any overclustering), a final cluster resolution to assess the high diversity of cell types was set at 0.9. The vascular tissue, composed of multiple small populations, required subsequent manual subdivision based on marker gene expression. 	The Cell Ranger suite (10x Genomics, version 3.0.2) was used to perform sample demultiplexing and to generate FASTQ files for read 1, read 2 and the i7 sample index for the libraries. Read 2 of the gene expression libraries was mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome (TAIR10.40) using STAR. Cell calling and removal of empty droplets was performed by applying the CB2 algorithm (Ni et al., 2020) to the raw feature cell barcode matrices generated by Cellranger count software. This results in the filtered digital gene expression matrices that were subsequently processed and filtered using Seurat (version 3.2.3 with R version 3.6.0) (Stuart et al., 2019). Low-abundance genes were removed by removing all genes that were not expressed in at least three cells and only protoplasts in which at least 200 genes were detected were retained. Finally, cells with a UMI count lower than 500 counts were removed.
