# Introduction or Background

Add to this section a couple of paragraphs introducing the work done dring the BioHackathon, CodeFest, VoCamp or Sprint event. Please add references whenever needed, for instance [@Katayama:2010].

Please separate paragraphs with a double line.

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels, even better if only two levels.

### Subsection level 3

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels.

## Tables, figures and so on

Please remember to introduce tables (see Table 1) before they appear on the document. We recommend to center tables, formulas and figure but not the corresponding captions. Feel free to modify the table style as it better suits to your data.

Table 1
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

Remember to introduce figures (see Figure 1) before they appear on the document.

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Feel free to use numbered lists or bullet points as you need.
* Item 1
* Item 2

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

And maybe you want to add a sentence or two on how you plan to continue. Please keep reading to learn about citations and references.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of parenthesis, last name and year. If you use a citation manager, Elsevier – Harvard or American Psychological Association (APA) will work. If you are referencing web pages, software or so, please do so in the same way. Whenever possible, add authors and year. We have included a couple of citations along this document for you to get the idea. Please remember to always add DOI whenever available, if not possible, please provide alternative URLs. You will end up with an alphabetical order list by authors’ last name.

# Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repositories and data repositories

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is

# Acknowledgements
Please always remember to acknowledge the BioHackathon, CodeFest, VoCamp, Sprint or similar where this work was (partially) developed.

# References

Leave thise section blank, create a paper.bib with all your references.
