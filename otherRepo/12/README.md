# Project 12: Creating the ELIXIR Data Stewardship/Management (DS/DM) Handbook - a guide for DS/DM to manage their life sciences RDM efforts

## Abstract

This project will develop the ELIXIR DS/DM Handbook to provide guidance on organising DS/DM activities in life sciences. The Handbook benefits DS/DM, including the emerging ELIXIR RDM Community (open to academia and industry beyond ELIXIR), offering a reference point and inspiration to develop their network and capacity.

In September 2022, attendees at the ELIXIR-CONVERGE WP1 Padua meeting raised the need for the Handbook. Starting in April 2023, three pilot chapters are in progress: (1) how to build a community, (2) DM/DS profiles, competencies and career paths, (3) an ELIXIR RDM maturity model/services profile. The Handbook format was chosen for its practical application, and motivating DS/DM to share experiences, preventing reinventing the wheel and siloed development in local organisations.

The Handbook is life-science focused with potential to expand to other disciplines. It differs from others due to its open access and community-led aspects, including best practices and community profile examples. Itâ€™s not a guide for providing training, nor a resource on data management (as there is RDMkit, FAIR Cookbook, DSW). The main activity is producing consensual goals and scope for the Handbook, then reviewing and expanding content accordingly, and prototyping the handbook as an online resource to maximise its openness and use.

This proposal is co-written by the following people who will be involved in organising the project: Martin Cook (ELIXIR-HUB), Pinar Alper (ELIXIR-LU), Krzys Poterlowicz (ELIXIR-UK), Robert Andrews (ELIXIR-UK), Munazah Andrabi (ELIXIR-UK), Brane Leskosek (ELIXIR-SL).

## More information

At the end of the BioHackathon, we have:

 * Defined the use of the Handbook for the DS/DM community in the context of activities, tools and services, in and beyond ELIXIR
 * Decided on the landing place for the Handbook to maximise its openness,
 * Added cross-links to communities and sections of RDMkit, FAIR Cookbook, DSW etc.
 * Reviewed content and created content based on needs and experiences
 * Created a sustainability plan as part of the emerging ELIXIR RDM Community

Within six months after the BioHackathon, we have:

 * Published a first version Handbook
 * Established an editorial board as part of the emerging ELIXIR RDM Community

All DS/DM from and beyond ELIXIR are invited to bring in their expertise, regardless of academic qualification. There is no minimum or maximum number. The Handbook format was chosen for its practical application, motivating DS/DM to share experiences.
