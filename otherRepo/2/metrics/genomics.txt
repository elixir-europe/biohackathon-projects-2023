# Quality and privacy metrics for synthetic genomic data
## Quality metrics
### Curated metrics from the literature
    - Proportion of reads on each chromosome 
    - Coverage 
    - Paired-end fragment length
    - Alignment quality
    - Rates of sequencing error
    - Substitution, insertion, and deletion rates
    - Quality scores for reads
    - GC-coverage bias 
    - Computational Cost
    - mapping sensitivity of bases in reads
    - mapping precision of mapped bases in reads
    - Loss function L(S), Badness function
    - Sequence data quality and characteristics across samples

  #### Statistical metrics
    - basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) 
    - graphical representations (e.g., box plots, histograms, violin plots)
    -  ML efficacy
    -  Fidelity (α-Precision)
    -  Diversity (β-Recall)
    - Generalization
    - GAN-train & GAN-test
    - Mean, the dispersion parameter of the NB, and the signal to noise ratio
