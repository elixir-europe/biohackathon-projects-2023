# Project 34: Training SPLASH

## Abstract

The Training SPLASH project aims to establish a digital environment representing a “one-stop-shop” for ELIXIR Training Platform (ETrP) services in order to increase its visibility, accessibility and usage and enable more participation within and outside the ELIXIR community. 

The ETrP has several successful training products, such as TeSS, the Train-the-Trainer programme, the FAIR training project, relevant papers, a training operational handbook containing guidelines etc. We aim to transform access to these resources by creating a single entry point for trainers, trainees, training providers, funders, training developers, and the other ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. 

SPLASH will adopt a user-centric approach to present the information sought in a ready-to-use format that will enable the packaging and visibility of the different training products, using the successful model of the RDMkit, and the ELIXIR Toolkit theme. The created digital resource will be connected with the ELIXIR website and TeSS with the possibility to connect to other services in the future. 

We aim to establish a diverse team composed of web developers, UX designers and content providers. An additional benefit of this project is to foster a collaborative environment for knowledge exchange, enabling members of the ETrP to continue updating the website (content and more) beyond the hackathon. The ultimate goal of SPLASH is to create a minimal viable version of this digital environment that will be publicly available by the end of the hackathon.

## More information

The short-term goal of the Training SPLASH project is to establish a digital resource as a minimal viable product during the BioHackathon 2023. This initial version of the digital resource will be extended during the next ELIXIR Training Platform Programme 2024-2028. 

We foresee a preparatory phase before the Biohackathon which includes having an initial wireframe and sufficient content readily available (content curation, sub pages etc) as well as the provisioning of a GitHub-hosted framework based on the ELIXIR Toolkit Theme template. 

The project should have a minimum of five people, with content expertise in ELIXIR training resources and technical expertise around the GitHub, Jekyll and UX design.
