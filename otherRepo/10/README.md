# Project 10: FAIR Workflow Execution with WfExS and Workflow Run Crate

## Abstract

FAIR Computational Workflows argues that workflows should be FAIR scholarly community research objects in their own right as a kind of FAIR Research Software. In this project we go one step further, and argue that workflow executions should also be published with sufficient traces and structured metadata. 

[Workflow Run RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/) is a set of profiles of [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/) that capture workflow provenance in a lightweight FAIR data package based on existing standards, in order to support traceability, reproducibility and interoperable description of diverse computational analysis. This use of RO-Crate allows the contextualization of a computational workflow and its execution, e.g. relating to people, organisations, projects, funding, data sources and wider research questions and studies.

We have implemented the profile in multiple workflow systems, including [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), [COMPSs](https://www.bsc.es/research-and-development/software-and-apps/software-list/comp-superscalar), [StreamFlow](https://streamflow.di.unito.it/), [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend), [Sapporo](https://github.com/sapporo-wes/sapporo), [Autosubmit](https://www.bsc.es/research-and-development/software-and-apps/software-list/autosubmit). The command line tool runcrate can convert from the precursor [CWLProv](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov) and display or validate crates according to the profiles. The crates are compatible with ELIXIR's [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu) and support increasing levels of details, including documenting ad-hoc scripts without a workflow engine.

[WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) is a workflow orchestrator designed for reproducible and secure workflow executions in isolated environments (like HPC). Every input, workflow and container being used in an execution must have either a public or permanent identifier, or at least a resolvable URI, so the execution scenario can be materialised. The execution scenario before and/or after the execution can be saved to [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/).

Here we bring together FAIR Computational Execution practitioners to mature and generalise this approach using Workflow Run Crate.

## More information

**Timeline for long and short-term goals**:
* Long-term: Common approach for interoperable FAIR workflow execution data by any workflow engine
* Short-term: Richer description of workflow executions, increased community participation

**Focus during the BioHackathon**:
* Establishing of FAIR Workflow Execution community
* Sharing workflow definitions and execution in WorkflowHub
* Track resource usage in existing workflow engines
* Display structured workflow provenance in a human-digestible form
* Integrate further with other FAIR standards, tools and repositories

**Minimum number of people to succeed**:
3-5

**Required level of expertise/skills to participate (one or more)**:
* Python (ideal) or other high-level language
* JSON-LD (ideal) or Linked Data in general
* Web development with JSON (schema.org ideal)
* Workflow system development
* Brief experience with writing and executing workflows

**Methodology used**: Pair programming, walk-throughs, brainstorming, Slack chat, Google Docs
